Do you know SwiftUI has Automatic Grammar Agreement you can implement it using ^....(inflect: true). I read somewhere it supports 6 languages but which are those 6 are unknown.
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var count = 1
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Add"){count += 1}
            Button("Remove"){count -= 1}
            Text("^[\(count) Person](inflect: true)")
                .padding()
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
